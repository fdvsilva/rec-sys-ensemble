[1] Batch Normalization
    - It's a technique for normalizing inputs at intermediate layers so as to
      speed up the learning process and bring some regularization in.
[2] Momentum
    - Physically, represents mass in motion.
    - In terms of machine learning, momentum increases changes torwards the
      dimensions where gradient did not change direction, thus, increasing
      the rate of convergence to the local minima.
[3] Kinetic Energy
    - It is the energy possessed by a moving object.
[4] Potential Energy
    - It is the stored energy possessed by an object.
[5] Gravitational Energy
    - Actually, gravitational energy is a subclass of potential energy, namely,
      the energy stored due to gravity.
